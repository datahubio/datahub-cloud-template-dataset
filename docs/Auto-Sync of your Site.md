# Auto-Sync of your Site

Auto-sync is enabled by default for newly created sites. This means the changes committed to your repository will automatically be reflected on your published site. You can choose to disable that if you want an additional layer of control before the changes get reflected on your published site. 

You can easily toggle this option on or off on your site's settings page.
